*** FIX PROTOCOL *** 

FIX - Financial Information eXchange protocol

created in 1992 to handle securites between fidelity and salomon brothers on an international real-time exchange

FIX is a string-based protocol, which implies that people can read it

Since FIX is string-based, parsers can take some time to process the stream, there are faster protocols including binary protocols


Two kinds of messages: 
    - administrative notifications that don't include any financial information
    - messages sent by the program to get pricing updates and orders

    contents of these messages take the form of key-value pairs

    predefined tags serve as keys, each tag number that corresponds to a particular characteristic
    values are associated with these tags


Protocols for FIX communication:
    
    trading system requires two connections:
        
        - one to receive price updates
        - one to place orders

    Price changes:
        
        - first feed to get is price updates, price updates -> orders from other market participants
        - trading system initiates a connection with the exchange to get a connection established and subscribe to liquidity updates

        Trading system = initiator
        Exchange = acceptor 

    Orders: 

        - second feed that trading system needs is communication with the exchange for the order side
        - once communication is established, the initiator will send orders to the exchange, if exchange needs to send updates regarding an order, it will use this channel of communication



    Important takeaway: 
        
        by initiating a trading session with an exchange, the trading system will send orders to the venue, order communications will be delivered to the exchange while
        this active trading session is open. The exchange will use FIX messages to transmit the status of these orders
