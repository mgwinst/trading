*** FAST PROTOCOL *** 

The FAST protocol = high speed FIX protocol

Market Data is transmitted from exchanges or feed handlers to market participants via the FAST protocol, which operates on top of UDP

Designed to use as little bandwidth as possible, hence it makes use of variety of compression techniques, 

    compression techniques:
        
        delta updates:
            - offers just changes, such as current price and previous price, instead of transferring all stocks and their related data

        variable-length encoding:
            - encodes each word to compress the raw data, although this increases processing complexity


Decoding must be done with shortest possible delay

UDP is used to transmit FAST messages
