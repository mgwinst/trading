memory pools -> avoid dynamic memory allocations

    by building custom memory pools, we can control the allocation/deallocation mechanisms, leading to more performance

    "memory pool" usually refers to a pool of objects fo a certain type


    process specfic memory pools can lead to better performance for few reasons: 

        reduced fragmentation -> we can allocate fixed size memory blocks, perfectly suited to the objects we manage
        
        improved locality of reference -> improve cache locality

        reduced synchronization overhead -> accessing system wide memory pool requires sync primitives to ensure thread safety, leads to contention (read more about this later)
