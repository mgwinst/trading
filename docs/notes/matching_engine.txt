*** MATCHING ENGINE ***

matching engine parameters: 

    - incoming order from trader
    - order book, containing orders already placed on the exchange

    returns list of the trades and list of resting orders, which is now the new orderbook input for the next trade

engine must handle different scenarios:

    - best price
    - partial fill
    - no match
    - multiple orders with same price
 


SOME RULES:

When orders are modified to reduce the quantity, the priority or position of the order in the
queue does not change

When orders are modified to increase the quantity or the price of the order is modified, it
has the equivalent effect of canceling the order and sending the order with the new price and
quantity values (i.e., a new priority will be assigned to it)
