<<< Trading System Architecture >>>

(big picture) Trading systems oversee collecting market data (price updates) and sending orders to the exchange

Venues: any platform matching buy and sell orders, venue can be exchange, ECN, aggregator, or bank

Trading systems need software called gateways to communicate with venues 

Book-builder: builds the limit order book from the data collected from gateways

Strategy: sends order to venues through the order manager

Order Manager (OMS): collects all orders coming from the strategies of the system, keeps track of life cycle of the orders 


^^^ these components are part of the critical path of sending orders to the market ^^^ 


Command and control:
    - in charge of starting the components of the system
    - link between traders and the trading system
    - could be CLI or GUI that receives orders from traders and routes them to necessary components
    - updates strategy parameters manually

Viewers: provides status of each component, order, trades and metrics (important for monitoring your strategies)

Gateways: 

    components that communicate with exchange and the trading system

    greediest in terms of execution time




CRITICAL COMPONENTS:

    - gateways
    - book builder
    - strategies
    - OMS (order management system)

    to determine performance of the system, we aggregate the processing times of each critical component

    When a price update enters trading system, we start a timer, when order generated by this price update leaves the system, we terminate the timer (tick-to-trade or tick-to-order)


NON-CRITICAL COMPONENTS:

    - components that are not directly related to the choice to submit an order
    - change settings, collect data, report data (think logging and tuning of the system)


SERVICES:

    - position server: keeps track of all trades and updates the positions for all traded assets
    - logging system: gathers all the logs from components and writes a file or modify database, for debugging and reporting
    - viewers: (read only interface) display views of positions, orders, trades, and task monitoring
    - control viewers: (interactive user interface) provides a way to modify parameters and stop/start components
    - news server: gathers and provides news in real time to the system
